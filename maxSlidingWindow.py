Time: O(n)
- The deque contains indices of elements in the current sliding window.
- When a new element is processed, the solution removes elements from the back of the deque that are **smaller** than the current element. This ensures that the deque only contains potential maximums.
- Each element can only be added to the deque once, and it can only be removed from the deque once. Therefore, each element is processed at most **twice** (once when it's added, once when it's removed).
- Hence, for each element, the operations on the deque (addition and removal) take **constant time** â€” O(1) for each add or remove operation.
